\usage{
yearCohorts(
  cohort,
  years,

\arguments{
\item{cohort}{A cohort table in a cdm reference.}

removed from the cohort set.}

\item{name}{Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.}

If set to FALSE four additional checks will be performed: 1) a check that

are no missing values in required columns, 3) a check that cohort duration is

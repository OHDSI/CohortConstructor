\usage{
exitAtObservationEnd(
  cohort,
  cohortId = NULL,
  persistAcrossObservationPeriods = FALSE,
  name = tableName(cohort),
  .softValidation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{A cohort table in a cdm reference.}

\item{cohortId}{Vector identifying which cohorts to modify
(cohort_definition_id or cohort_name). If NULL, all cohorts will be
used; otherwise, only the specified cohorts will be modified, and the
rest will remain unchanged.}

\item{persistAcrossObservationPeriods}{If FALSE, limits the cohort to one entry per
person, ending at the current observation period. If TRUE, subsequent
observation periods will create new cohort entries (starting from the start
of that observation period and ending at the end of that observation
period).}

\item{name}{Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.}

\item{.softValidation}{Whether to perform a soft validation of consistency.
If set to FALSE four additional checks will be performed: 1) a check that
cohort end date is not before cohort start date,  2) a check that there
are no missing values in required columns, 3) a check that cohort duration is
all within observation period, and 4) that there are no overlapping
cohort entries}
}
\value{
The cohort table.
}
\description{
\code{exitAtObservationEnd()} resets cohort end date based on a set of specified
column dates. The last date that occurs is chosen.

This functions changes cohort end date to the end date of the observation
period corresponding to the cohort entry. In the case were this generates
overlapping records in the cohort, overlapping entries will be merged.

\title{Require cohort subjects are present in another cohort}
\usage{
requireConceptIntersectFlag(
  x,
  conceptSet,
  indexDate = "cohort_start_date",
  targetStartDate = "event_start_date",
  targetEndDate = "event_end_date",
  censorDate = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Cohort table.}

\item{conceptSet}{Concept set list.}

\item{indexDate}{Variable in x that contains the date to compute the
intersection.}

\item{targetStartDate}{Date of reference in cohort table, either for start
(in overlap) or on its own (for incidence).}

\item{targetEndDate}{Date of reference in cohort table, either for end
(overlap) or NULL (if incidence).}

\item{censorDate}{Whether to censor overlap events at a specific date or a
column date of x.}

\item{window}{Window to consider events over.}

\item{negate}{If set as TRUE, criteria will be applied as exclusion
rather than inclusion (i.e. require absence in another cohort).}
}
\value{
Cohort table with only those in the other cohort kept
}
\description{
Require cohort subjects are present in another cohort

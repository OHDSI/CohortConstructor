\title{Restrict cohort on patient demographics}
\usage{
requireDemographics(
  cohort,
  cohortId = NULL,
  indexDate = "cohort_start_date",
  ageRange = list(c(0, 150)),
  sex = c("Both"),
  minPriorObservation = 0,
  minFutureObservation = 0,
  atFirst = FALSE,
  name = tableName(cohort),
  .softValidation = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort}{A cohort table in a cdm reference.}

\item{cohortId}{Vector identifying which cohorts to modify
(cohort_definition_id or cohort_name). If NULL, all cohorts will be
used; otherwise, only the specified cohorts will be modified, and the
rest will remain unchanged.}

\item{indexDate}{Variable in cohort that contains the date to compute the
demographics characteristics on which to restrict on.}

\item{ageRange}{A list of vectors specifying minimum and maximum age.}

\item{sex}{Can be "Both", "Male" or "Female".}

\item{minPriorObservation}{A minimum number of continuous prior observation
days in the database.}

\item{minFutureObservation}{A minimum number of continuous future observation
days in the database.}

\item{atFirst}{If FALSE the requirement will be applied to all subject's
entries, if TRUE, it will only be applied to the first entry of the subject.}

\item{name}{Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.}

\item{.softValidation}{Whether to perform a soft validation of consistency.
If set to FALSE four additional checks will be performed: 1) a check that
cohort end date is not before cohort start date,  2) a check that there
are no missing values in required columns, 3) a check that cohort duration is
all within observation period, and 4) that there are no overlapping
cohort entries}
}
\value{
The cohort table with only records for individuals satisfying the
demographic requirements

\description{

individuals satisfy the specified demographic criteria.

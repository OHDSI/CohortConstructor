\usage{
conceptCohort(
  cdm,
  conceptSet,
  name,
  exit = "event_end_date",
  useSourceFields = FALSE,
  subsetCohort = NULL,
  subsetCohortId = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdm}{A cdm reference.}

\item{conceptSet}{A conceptSet, which can either be a codelist
or a conceptSetExpression.}

\item{name}{Name of the new cohort table created in the cdm object.}

\item{exit}{How the cohort end date is defined. Can be either
"event_end_date" or "event_start_date".}

\item{useSourceFields}{If TRUE, the source concept_id fields will also be
used when identifying relevant clinical records. If FALSE, only the standard
concept_id fields will be used.}

\item{subsetCohort}{A cohort table containing individuals for whom cohorts
will be generated. Only individuals in this table will appear in the
generated cohort.}

\item{subsetCohortId}{Optional. Specifies cohort IDs from the \code{subsetCohort}
table to include. If none are provided, all cohorts from the \code{subsetCohort}
are included.}

\item{overlap}{How to deal with overlapping records. In all
cases cohort start will be set as the earliest start date. If
"merge", cohort end will be the latest end date. If "extend",
cohort end date will be set by adding together the total days
from each of the overlapping records.}

A cohort table

\description{
\code{conceptCohort()} creates a cohort table from patient records
from the clinical tables in the OMOP CDM.

The following tables are currently supported for creating concept
cohorts:
\itemize{
\item condition_occurrence
\item device_exposure
\item drug_exposure
\item measurement
\item observation
\item procedure_occurrence
\item visit_occurrence
}

Cohort duration is based on record start and end (e.g.
condition_start_date and condition_end_date for records coming
from the condition_occurrence tables). So that the resulting table
satisfies the requirements of an OMOP CDM cohort table:
\itemize{
\item Cohort entries will not overlap. Overlapping records will be
combined based on the overlap argument.
\item Cohort entries will not go out of observation. If a record starts
outside of an observation period it will be silently ignored. If a
record ends outside of an observation period it will be trimmed so
as to end at the preceding observation period end date.
}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
library(CohortConstructor)

cdm <- mockCohortConstructor(conditionOccurrence = TRUE)

cohort <- conceptCohort(cdm = cdm, conceptSet = list(a = 1), name = "cohort")

cohort |> attrition()
}
}

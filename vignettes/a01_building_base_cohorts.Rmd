## Introduction 

Let's first create a cdm reference to the Eunomia synthetic data.

```{r}
library(CDMConnector)
library(CodelistGenerator)
library(PatientProfiles)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), 
                      dbdir = eunomiaDir())
cdm <- cdmFromCon(con, cdmSchema = "main", writeSchema = "main", 
                  writePrefix = "my_study_")
```

## Concept based cohort creation

A way of defining base cohorts is to identify clinical records with codes from some pre-specified list. Here for example we'll first find codes for diclofenac and acetaminophen. 

```{r}
drug_codes <- getDrugIngredientCodes(cdm, 
                                     name = c("acetaminophen",
                                              "amoxicillin", 
                                              "diclofenac", 
                                              "simvastatin",
                                              "warfarin"))

drug_codes
```

Now we have our codes of interest, we'll make cohorts for each of these where cohort exit is defined as the event start date (which for these will be their drug exposure end date).

```{r}
cdm$drugs <- conceptCohort(cdm, 
                           conceptSet = drug_codes,
                           exit = "event_end_date",
                           name = "drugs")

settings(cdm$drugs)
cohortCount(cdm$drugs)
attrition(cdm$drugs)
```

## Demographic based cohort creation

One base cohort we can create is based around patient demographics. Here for example we create a cohort where people enter on their 18th birthday and leave at on the day before their 66th birthday. 

```{r}
cdm$working_age_cohort <- demographicsCohort(cdm = cdm, 
                                             ageRange = c(18, 65), 
                                             name = "working_age_cohort")

settings(cdm$working_age_cohort)
cohortCount(cdm$working_age_cohort)
attrition(cdm$working_age_cohort)
```

We can also add an additional requirement of only people of working age with sex "female".

```{r}
cdm$female_working_age_cohort <- demographicsCohort(cdm = cdm, 
                                             ageRange = c(18, 65),
                                             sex = "Female",
                                             name = "female_working_age_cohort")

settings(cdm$female_working_age_cohort)
cohortCount(cdm$female_working_age_cohort)
attrition(cdm$female_working_age_cohort)
```

We can also use this function to create cohorts for different combinations of age groups and sex.

```{r}
cdm$age_sex_cohorts <- demographicsCohort(cdm = cdm, 
                                             ageRange = list(c(0, 17), c(18, 65), c(66,120)),
                                             sex = c("Female", "Male"),
                                             name = "age_sex_cohorts")

settings(cdm$age_sex_cohorts)
cohortCount(cdm$age_sex_cohorts)
attrition(cdm$age_sex_cohorts)

```

We can also specify the minimum number of days of prior observation required.


```{r}
cdm$working_age_cohort_0_365 <- demographicsCohort(cdm = cdm, 
                                             ageRange = c(18, 65), 
                                             name = "working_age_cohort_0_365",
                                             minPriorObservation = c(0,365))

settings(cdm$working_age_cohort_0_365)
cohortCount(cdm$working_age_cohort_0_365)
attrition(cdm$working_age_cohort_0_365)

```

## Measurement Cohort

```{r, include = FALSE}
cdm <- mockCohortConstructor(con = NULL)
cdm$concept <- cdm$concept |>
  dplyr::union_all(
    dplyr::tibble(
      concept_id = c(4245997, 9531, 4069590),
      concept_name = c("Body mass index", "kilogram per square meter", "Normal"),
      domain_id = "Measurement",
      vocabulary_id = c("SNOMED", "UCUM", "SNOMED"),
      standard_concept = "S",
      concept_class_id = c("Observable Entity", "Unit", "Qualifier Value"),
      concept_code = NA,
      valid_start_date = NA,
      valid_end_date = NA,
      invalid_reason = NA
    )
  )
cdm$measurement <- dplyr::tibble(
  measurement_id = 1:6,
  person_id = c(1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2),
  measurement_concept_id = c(4245997, 4245997, 4245997, 4245997, 4245997, 4245997),
  measurement_date = as.Date(c("2009-07-01", "2000-12-11", "1999-09-08",
                                "2015-02-19", "2016-08-22", "1965-03-10")),
  measurement_type_concept_id = NA,
  value_as_number = c(18, 36, 0, 29, 0, 25),
  value_as_concept_id = c(0, 0, 4069590, 4069590, 4069590, 0),
  unit_concept_id = c(9531, 9531, 0, 9531, 0, 9531)
)
cdm <- CDMConnector::copyCdmTo(
  con = DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb()),
  cdm = cdm, schema = "main")
```

Another base cohort we can create is based around patient measurements. Here for example we create a cohort of patients who have a normal BMI (BMI between 18 and 25). To do this you must first identify the measurement you want to look at (in this case BMI (concept id = 4245997)), the unit of measurement (kg per square-meter (concept id = 9531)) and 'normal' value concept (concept id = 4069590). The value concept is included for the cases where the exact BMI measurement is not specified, but the BMI category (i.e. normal, overweight, obese etc) is. This means that if a record matches the value concept OR has a normal BMI score then it is included in the cohort.

```{r}
cdm$cohort <- measurementCohort(
  cdm = cdm,
  name = "cohort",
  conceptSet = list("bmi_normal" = c(4245997)),
  valueAsConcept = c(4069590),
  valueAsNumber = list("9531" = c(18, 25))
)

attrition(cdm$cohort)
settings(cdm$cohort)
cdm$cohort
```

As you can see in the above code, the concept set is the list of BMI concepts, the concept value is the 'normal' weight concept, and the values are the minimum and maximum BMI scores to be considered.

It is also possible to include records outside of observation by setting the `inObservation` argument to false.

```{r}
cdm$cohort <- measurementCohort(
  cdm = cdm,
  name = "cohort",
  conceptSet = list("bmi_normal" = c(4245997)),
  valueAsConcept = c(4069590),
  valueAsNumber = list("9531" = c(18, 25)),
  inObservation = FALSE
)

attrition(cdm$cohort)
settings(cdm$cohort)
cdm$cohort
```
## Death cohort

Another base cohort we can make is one with individuals who have died. For this we'll simply be finding those people in the OMOP CDM death table and creating a cohort with them.

```{r}
cdm$death_cohort <- deathCohort(cdm = cdm,
                                name = "death_cohort")
```

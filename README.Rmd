The goal of CohortConstructor is to support the creation and manipulation of study cohorts in data mapped to the OMOP CDM.  

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CohortConstructor")
```

Or you can install the development version of the package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ohdsi/CohortConstructor")
```

## Creating and manipulating cohorts

To illustrate the functionality provided by CohortConstructor let's create a set of fracture cohorts using the Eunomia dataset. We'll first load required packages and create a cdm reference for the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(omopgenerics)
library(CDMConnector)
library(PatientProfiles)
library(dplyr)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(CohortCharacteristics)
```

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = eunomia_dir())
cdm <- cdm_from_con(con, cdm_schema = "main", 
                    write_schema = c(prefix = "my_study_", schema = "main"))
cdm
```

### Generating concept-based fracture cohorts

We will start by making a simple concept-based cohort for each of our fracture of interest. First we create a codelist for each ankle, forearm and hip fractures (note, we just use one code for each because we are using synthetic data). 

```{r, message=TRUE}
fracture_codes <- newCodelist(list("ankle_fracture" = 4059173L,
                                   "forearm_fracture" = 4278672L,
                                   "hip_fracture" = 4230399L))
fracture_codes
```

Now we can quickly create a set of cohorts for each fracture type. For this we only need to provide the codes we have defined and we will get a cohort back, with cohort end date set as the event date associated with the records, overlapping records collapsed, and only records in observation kept.

```{r}
cdm$fractures <- cdm |> 
  conceptCohort(conceptSet = fracture_codes,
  name = "fractures")
```

We can see that our starting cohorts, before we add any additional restrictions, have the following associated settings, counts, and attrition.

```{r}
settings(cdm$fractures) %>% glimpse()
cohort_count(cdm$fractures) %>% glimpse()
attrition(cdm$fractures) %>% glimpse()
```

### Create an overall fracture cohort

So far we have created three separate fracture cohorts. Let's say we also want a cohort of people with any of the fractures. We could union our three cohorts to create this overall cohort like so:

```{r, message=FALSE}
cdm$fractures <- unionCohorts(cdm$fractures,
                              cohortName = "any_fracture", 
                              keepOriginalCohorts = TRUE,
                              name ="fractures")
```

```{r, message=FALSE}
settings(cdm$fractures)
cohortCount(cdm$fractures)
```

### Require in date range

Once we have created our base fracture cohort, we can then start applying additional cohort requirements. For example, first we can require that individuals' cohort start date fall within a certain date range.

```{r}
cdm$fractures <- cdm$fractures %>% 
  requireInDateRange(dateRange = as.Date(c("2000-01-01", "2020-01-01")))
```

Now that we've applied this date restriction, we can see that our cohort attributes have been updated

```{r}
cohort_count(cdm$fractures) %>% glimpse()
attrition(cdm$fractures) %>% 
  filter(reason == "cohort_start_date between 2000-01-01 & 2020-01-01") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

### Applying demographic requirements

We can also add restrictions on patient characteristics such as age (on cohort start date by default) and sex.

```{r}
cdm$fractures <- cdm$fractures %>% 
  requireDemographics(ageRange = list(c(40, 65)),
                      sex = "Female")
```

Again we can see how many individuals we've lost after applying these criteria.

```{r}
attrition(cdm$fractures) %>% 
  filter(reason == "Age requirement: 40 to 65") %>% 
  glimpse()

attrition(cdm$fractures) %>% 
  filter(reason == "Sex requirement: Female") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

### Require presence in another cohort

We can also require that individuals are (or are not) in another cohort over some window. Here for example we require that study participants are in a GI bleed cohort any time prior up to their entry in the fractures cohort.

```{r}
cdm$gibleed <- cdm |> 
  conceptCohort(conceptSet = list("gibleed" = 192671L),
  name = "gibleed")

cdm$fractures <- cdm$fractures %>% 
  requireCohortIntersect(targetCohortTable = "gibleed",
                         intersections = 0,
                         window = c(-Inf, 0))
```

```{r}
attrition(cdm$fractures) %>% 
  filter(reason == "Not in cohort gibleed between -Inf & 0 days relative to cohort_start_date") %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{r}
cdmDisconnect(cdm)
```

### More information
CohortConstructor provides much more functionality for creating and manipulating cohorts. See the package website for more details.
